# Notification-Listener-Extension
Notification-Listener-Extension for App Inventor But it has some error so try to Solve this by contributing.

Result I'm Getting from it
1. Android is Denied to give permission : 
**BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE**
2. We are able to get **Notification access** by adding service in manifest
3. when we call **.GetNotificationByPackageName** it showing Error: 
**Attempt to invoke virtual method ‘java.lang.stringorg.json.JSONArray.toString()’ on a null object reference**
4. **GetAllNotification** Block returning Empty result may be because of permission
